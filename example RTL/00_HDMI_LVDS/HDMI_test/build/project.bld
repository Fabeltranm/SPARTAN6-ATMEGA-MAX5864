WARNING:ConstraintSystem:119 - Constraint <NET "prueba" LOC = p105 |>
   [../HDMI_test.ucf(11)]: This constraint cannot be distributed from the design
   objects matching 'NET "prueba"' because those design objects do not contain
   or drive any instances of the correct type.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - A target design object for the Locate constraint
   '<NET "prueba" LOC = p105 |> [../HDMI_test.ucf(11)]' could not be found and
   so the Locate constraint will be removed.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:119 - Constraint <IOSTANDARD = LVCMOS33;>
   [../HDMI_test.ucf(11)]: This constraint cannot be distributed from the design
   objects matching 'NET "prueba"' because those design objects do not contain
   or drive any instances of the correct type.

INFO:ConstraintSystem - The Period constraint <PERIOD = 100 MHz;>
   [../HDMI_test.ucf(10)], is specified using the Net Period method which is not
   recommended. Please use the Timespec PERIOD method.
