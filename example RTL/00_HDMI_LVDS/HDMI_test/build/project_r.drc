WARNING:PhysDesignRules:774 - Unexpected DCM configuration. CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT
   is not configured VARIABLE for comp DCM_TMDS_inst. The PSEN pin is connected
   to an active signal. The PSEN pin should be connected to GND to guarantee the
   expected operation.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:1861 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp DCM_TMDS_inst, consult
   the device Data Sheet.
